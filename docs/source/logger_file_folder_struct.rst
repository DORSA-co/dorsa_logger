Logger Folder and File Structure
---------------------------------
The folder and file structure created by the logger module is designed to organize log files 
based on the current date and time. This structure helps keep log entries easily accessible, and categorized based on 
the date and time of their creation and makes it convenient for developers to analyze and troubleshoot 
issues and track system behavior over time.

The overall logger folder and file structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    Main Folder/
        |___ Daily Folder/
                 |___ Log File

Main Folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The main folder is the starting point for storing all log files. 
You can choose the name and location of this folder by providing the main_folderpath parameter 
(see subsection :ref:`mainFolderPath-subsection`).
This folder will hold all the logs generated by the module.

Daily Folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Inside the main folder, a new subfolder is created for each day. The folder's name is based on the current date
in the type and format specified by date_type and date_format parameters (see subsection :ref:`dateAndTime-subsection`).
The module automatically generates a new daily folder when the date changes.

Log File
^^^^^^^^^
Within each daily folder, individual log files are created for each log entry. 
The log file names include the date and time the log entry was created. 
The format of the time is specified by time_format parameter (see subsection :ref:`dateAndTime-subsection`).

Log Entry Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Inside each log file, the log messages are stored in a structured format. 
Each log message includes the date, time, log level (see subsection :ref:`logLevels-subsection`), 
the current username (if provided), and the log message itself. 
The log messages are separated by a line separator (see subsection :ref:`lineSeperator-subsection`): 
for better readability.

Changing Log Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As time passes and the date changes (e.g., at midnight), 
the module will automatically create a new daily folder for the updated date, 
and new log files will be generated accordingly. 
This ensures that log files remain organized and easy to manage, with each day's logs stored separately.
